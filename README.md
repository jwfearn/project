# thehelp-project

This project is designed to get a high quality grunt-based project automation setup in place very quickly.

## Features

Grunt task setup:

* `time-grunt`
* `env`, loading environment variables from env.json
* `mocha-cli` for 'unit', 'integration' and 'interactive' tasks, running everything underneath 'test/<test type>' excluding the 'client' subdirectory
* command-line options supported for tests: 'grep', 'coverage', 'reporter' and 'bail'
* staticanalysis, encompassing two tasks: `jshint` and `complexity`
* style, using the highly-configurable `jscs`
* doc, wrapping two tasks: `groc` and `fix-groc-stylesheet`
* `watch` core setup and subtasks for tests, static analysis, style and documentation generation
* `modifiedInLast()` method to filter files processed using the grunt 'partial' command-line option
* `clean`, deleting 'public/*', 'tmp/*', and 'dist/*' by default, and extended to include files under doc if you call `registerDoc()`

## Jump in!

### Install

Include the project in your dependencies:

```
npm install thehelp-project --save-dev
```

### Usage

To get up and running very quickly with all defaults, you can use this as your whole Gruntfile:

```
var GruntConfig = require('thehelp-project').GruntConfig;

module.exports = function(grunt) {
  var config = new GruntConfig(grunt);

  config.standardSetup();
  config.standardDefault();
};
```

## History

### 2.5.1 (2014-05-26)

* Turn off `jscs` option 'requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers' since there's no mechanism for exceptions, and we do need to interact with external services whose parameters are often not in camelcase. `jshint` already covers this anyway.

### 2.5.0 (2014-05-21)

* add new 'style' task based on the style checking capabilities of [`jscs`](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs). Take a look at `.jscsrc` in the root directory for the default set of rules. You can supply a path to the second parameter of `registerStyle` to provide your own config file, and you might want to, since it's pretty opinionated.
* Update some dev dependencies

### 2.4.6 (2014-05-17)

* split 'jshint:all' task into 'test' and 'src' tasks. 'test' task has one warning turned off:

  - -W030: Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression

### 2.4.5 (2014-04-28)

* task 'mochacli:all' properly excludes javascript files in the root test folder
* Minor version updates: `grunt-shell`
* Patch updates: `grunt-requirejs`

### 2.4.4 (2014-04-02)

* Updated minor versions: `grunt-contrib-jshint`, `grunt-mocha-cli`
* Updated patch versions: `grunt-complexity`

### 2.4.3 (2014-03-27)

* Added 'sa' alias for the combined jshint/complexity 'staticanalysis' task

### 2.4.2 (2014-03-21)

* Patch versions: groc (actually a no-op change; fixing tag version to match package.json)
* Minor versions: grunt-contrib-jshint (better error output! woo!), grunt-contrib-watch, grunt-mocha-cli, time-grunt (color!)
* Dev dependencies: chai, grunt

### 2.4.1 (2014-03-13)

* Upgrading to [groc@0.6.4 (from my branch)](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/groc/releases/tag/v0.6.4). Pulls in `jade` 1.x, something that the main `groc` project has resisted doing. But it didn't even change the generated documentation.

### 2.4.0 (2014-03-09)

* `registerOptimize()` now turns on source map generation unless it's been explicitly configured.

### 2.3.0 (2014-03-07)

* Patch updates: grunt-complexity, grunt-groc, grunt-mocha, grunt-requirejs, grunt-shell, time-grunt, grunt
* Minor version updates: chai, sinon
* Minor version below v1 (could be breaking changes): grunt-contrib-connect, grunt-contrib-connect, grunt-contrib-jshint

### 2.2.0 (2013-12-23)

* Turn on 90-character limit per line

### 2.1.4 (2013-12-22)

* Update to my fork of `groc` which prevents it from being broken after `jade` 1.0.0 release

### 2.1.3 (2013-12-21)

* Fix crash if 'bower_components' folder doesn't exist

### 2.1.2 (2013-12-16)

* updating minor version: `grunt-mocha-cli` (now at mocha 1.15, also has my [pull request](https://github.com/Rowno/grunt-mocha-cli/pull/8))
* updating patch version: `grunt-env`, `grunt-mocha`, `time-grunt` (time grunt update actually brings its output back under `grunt` 0.4.2)

### 2.1.1 (2013-12-14)

* adding `async` to `bowerSpecialCases`

### 2.1.0 (2013-12-02)

* new: task 'test-all' for easy code coverage testing

### 2.0.0 (2013-12-02)

* `registerCopy()` now takes options param, not files
* `registerCopyFromDist()` now creates just one target
* new: `registerInstall()` for 'npm/bower install'
* new: 'setup' task for installing dependencies

### 1.4.1 (2013-11-30)

* can use `bowerSpecialCases` to customize the behavior of `registerCopyFromBower()`. two special-cases are included by default: lodash (dist/lodash.compat.js) and requirejs (require.js)

### 1.4.0 (2013-11-29)

* new method: `registerCopyFromBower()` - pulls javascript files installed by bower into your lib/vendor directory
* `registerCopy()` can be called more than once; also called by `registerCopyFromBower()` and `registerCopyFromDist` to ensure `grunt-contrib-copy` task is ready for use
* dependency update: latest versions of lodash, grunt-contrib-jshint, grunt-mocha, time-grunt, and grunt

### 1.3.0 (2013-11-22)

* registerTest: now allows customization of source files to ensure that your 'run-on-change' task behaves properly

### 1.2.3 (2013-11-22)

* Re-ordering parameters in registerStaticAnalysis (now it's files first, then jshintrc path)

### 1.2.2 (2013-11-19)

* Fix to registerOptimize: fix task name collision for multiple libraries based off of the same root javascript file

### 1.2.1 (2013-11-19)

* Fix to registerOptimize: allow multiple libraries based off of the same root javascript file (take name for task from the output file, not the input file)

### 1.2.0 (2013-11-18)

* new method: `registerCopyFromDist()` - pulls files out of `dist/` folders of installed node modules
* `registerCopy()` files parameter now optional

### 1.1.0 (2013-11-17)

* new method: `registerCopy()` - pulls in `grunt-contrib-copy` task, passes `files` parameter to it
* new method: `registerConnect()` - sets up two targets: test (port 3001) and keepalive (port 3000)
* new method: `registerOptimize()` - uses `grunt-requirejs` to optimize and concatenate AMD files, producing unoptimized and, if requested, standalone files based on almond.js
* new method: `registerMocha()` - running phantomjs-based in-browser unit tests. Works well with `registerConnect()`

### 1.0.3 (2013-11-14)

* adding 'dist' target to  `registerClean()`

### 1.0.2 (2013-11-11)

* `registerStaticAnalysis()` uses .jshintrc file inside this project by default, to make it that much easier to set up a new project.

### 1.0.1 (2013-11-11)

* new: `loadLocalNpm()` loads tasks from node modules installed as dependencies of this library, not from the project which is using this library.

### 1.0.0 (2013-11-11)

* Initial release
* time-grunt, env, testing with mocha-cli, jshint, complexity, groc and fix-groc-stylesheet, clean, watch, filter, code coverage support in testing,
