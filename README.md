# thehelp-project

This project is designed to get high quality grunt-based project automation in place very quickly, with just one entry in your package.json.

## Features

* [`time-grunt`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/time-grunt), tracking how long your grunt tasks take
* [`env`](https://github.com/jsoverson/grunt-env), loading environment variables from env.json
* [`mocha-cli`](https://github.com/Rowno/grunt-mocha-cli) for 'unit', 'integration' and 'manual' tasks, running [`mocha`](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) tests underneath 'test/<test type>' excluding the 'client' subdirectory
* command-line options supported for tests: 'grep', 'coverage', 'reporter' and 'bail'
* static analysis, using two tasks: [`jshint`](http://www.jshint.com/) and [`complexity`](https://github.com/philbooth/complexity-report)
* style checking, using the highly-configurable [`jscs`](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs)
* documentation generation via [`groc`](https://github.com/nevir/groc) (with a few stylesheet tweaks)
* [`watch`](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) core setup and subtasks for tests, static analysis, style and documentation generation
* grunt 'partial' command-line option to cut down watch task run times (via `modifiedInLast()`)
* [`clean`](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-clean), deleting everything under 'public/', 'tmp/', and 'dist/' by default, and extended to include files under 'doc/' along with documentation generation setup

## Setup

First, install the project as a dev dependency:

```
npm install thehelp-project --save-dev
```

Then make sure you have the grunt installed locally and the `grunt` command available:

```
npm install grunt --save-dev
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### Your Gruntfile

The easiest way to use this project is to take all the defaults. To do that, you can use this as your whole Gruntfile:

```javascript
var GruntConfig = require('thehelp-project').GruntConfig;

module.exports = function(grunt) {
  var config = new GruntConfig(grunt);

  config.standardSetup();
  config.standardDefault();
};
```
With just that you've got quite a few new grunt tasks available to you! You can take a look by typing `grunt --help`, or you can just type `grunt` and the default task will do quite a bit. But you may want to do a little more setup first...

### Expected project structure

Now, again using all the defaults, you'll have to structure your project in the way `thehelp-project` expects:

```
├ README.md       becomes doc/index.html
├ env.json        environment variables needed by your project
├ docs/           all groc-generated doc files added here
├ src/            core source files
├ tasks/          any grunt tasks your project exposes
└ test/
  ├ unit/         unit tests
  │ └ client/     files under client/ in all three test directories are excluded
  ├ integration/  integration tests
  └ manual/       manual tests (will not be run as part of 'grunt test')
```

### Code coverage

To use code coverage functionality, you'll need to have [`blanket`](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket) installed as a dev dependency at the top level in your project:

```
npm install blanket --save-dev
```

In your package.json you'll need some configuration information to let `blanket` know which files you want to instrument for code coverage. I usually use something like this:

```
"config": {
  "blanket": {
    "data-cover-only": "src",
    "data-cover-never": "['lib/','node_modules/','test/','src/client']"
  }
}
```

### Documentation generation

To use `groc`-based documentation generation, you'll need to have [Pygments](http://pygments.org/docs/installation/) installed. On OSX, the easiest way to install it is:

```
sudo easy_install Pygments
```

Even on non-OSX, `easy_install` is still the the right way to install it. You'll just need to pull down [Python](http://www.python.org/getit/) to get it.


## Usage

### Testing

Put some `mocha` tests in place, then try these commands:

```
grunt unit
grunt integration
grunt manual

# just unit and integration tests
grunt test
# all three types of tests
grunt test-all

grunt test --bail
grunt test --grep searchPattern
grunt test --reporter nyan
grunt test-all --coverage > result.html && open result.html
```

### Static analysis

For static analysis delivered by `jshint` and `complexity`:

```
grunt sa
grunt staticanalysis
```

### Code style

For code style checking, delivered by `jscs`:

```
grunt style
```

### Generate documentation

`groc` generates html files from markdown in your source files' comments.

```
grunt doc
```

### Clean

Three directories are registered by default: 'dist/', 'tmp/', and 'public/'. If you set documentation generation up with `standardSetup()` or call `registerDoc()` a fourth directory will be added: 'doc/'

```
grunt clean
grunt clean:tmp
grunt clean:dist
grunt clean:public
grunt clean:doc
```

## Advanced

### Watch

Five sub-tasks are supported for the `watch` file-watching task from `grunt-contrib-watch`:

* unit
* integration
* staticanalysis
* style
* doc

Because, for large projects, you may not want to run these entire tasks every time one file changes, a `partial` option is available which limits the set of files to the set modified in the last N minutes.

```
grunt watch:staticanalysis
grunt watch:doc --partial 3
grunt watch:unit

# note: when filtering, you'll need to modify the test files
grunt watch:unit --partial 3
```

### Going past the defaults

The first level of customization is adding to what `thehelp-project` provides. For example, if you'd like to add a new `clean` target, you can add to its grunt configuration with a targeted update:

```
grunt.config('clean.build', {
  src: ['build/**/*']
})
```

The next step is changing things by passing data to `standardSetup()`. For example, if you'd like to provide your own `jshint` and `jscs` rules, you can do this to load your own local config files:

```javascript
config.standardSetup({
  staticAnalysis: {
    jshintrc: '.jshintrc'
  },
  style: {
    jscsrc: '.jscsrc'
  }
})

```

If you would like to eliminate setup for a given task completely, you can always bypass the `standardSetup()` function. This example just loads what it needs - it will add its own test-related tasks later:

```javascript
this.setupTimeGrunt();
this.registerWatch();
this.registerEnv();
this.registerClean();

this.registerStaticAnalysis();
this.registerStyle();
this.registerDoc();
```

## Some additional notes

This project uses my fork of `groc` for a few reasons. Without my changes:

* Full file paths from original machine are generated into behavior.js
* `jade` dependency is locked to pre-1.x
* Package is not protected against future breaking changes due to '>=' dependency versions

Lastly, this project is really just a collection of other open-source projects. Many thanks to everyone before me who has provided such value to the community. I hope to continue that fine tradition.

## History

### 3.0.0 (2014-06-07)

* Every `registerXXX()` method now takes one options parameter, looking for keys on it, instead of direct parameters.
* `standardSetup()` now takes an `options` parameter, allowing for full customization without calling `registerXXX()` methods directly. `options.watch` is passed to `registerWatch()`, for example.
* `grunt interactive` is now `grunt manual` (still excluded from `grunt test` and included in `grunt test-all`)
* Overhaul of all documentation
* All client-side development task configuration removed, to be released in a forthcoming `thehelp-client-project`: `registerConnect()`, `registerMocha()`, `registerOptimize()`, `registerCopyFromBower()` and `registerCopyFromDist()`
* Update to latest version of my `groc` fork
* Update dev dependencies

### 2.5.2 (2014-05-27)

* Pare down what's in npm package

### 2.5.1 (2014-05-26)

* Turn off `jscs` option 'requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers' since there's no mechanism for exceptions, and we do need to interact with external services whose parameters are often not in camelcase. `jshint` already covers this anyway.

### 2.5.0 (2014-05-21)

* add new 'style' task based on the style checking capabilities of [`jscs`](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs). Take a look at `.jscsrc` in the root directory for the default set of rules. You can supply a path to the second parameter of `registerStyle` to provide your own config file, and you might want to, since it's pretty opinionated.
* Update some dev dependencies

### 2.4.6 (2014-05-17)

* split 'jshint:all' task into 'test' and 'src' tasks. 'test' task has one warning turned off:

  - -W030: Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression

### 2.4.5 (2014-04-28)

* task 'mochacli:all' properly excludes javascript files in the root test folder
* Minor version updates: `grunt-shell`
* Patch updates: `grunt-requirejs`

### 2.4.4 (2014-04-02)

* Updated minor versions: `grunt-contrib-jshint`, `grunt-mocha-cli`
* Updated patch versions: `grunt-complexity`

### 2.4.3 (2014-03-27)

* Added 'sa' alias for the combined jshint/complexity 'staticanalysis' task

### 2.4.2 (2014-03-21)

* Patch versions: groc (actually a no-op change; fixing tag version to match package.json)
* Minor versions: grunt-contrib-jshint (better error output! woo!), grunt-contrib-watch, grunt-mocha-cli, time-grunt (color!)
* Dev dependencies: chai, grunt

### 2.4.1 (2014-03-13)

* Upgrading to [groc@0.6.4 (from my branch)](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/groc/releases/tag/v0.6.4). Pulls in `jade` 1.x, something that the main `groc` project has resisted doing. But it didn't even change the generated documentation.

### 2.4.0 (2014-03-09)

* `registerOptimize()` now turns on source map generation unless it's been explicitly configured.

### 2.3.0 (2014-03-07)

* Patch updates: grunt-complexity, grunt-groc, grunt-mocha, grunt-requirejs, grunt-shell, time-grunt, grunt
* Minor version updates: chai, sinon
* Minor version below v1 (could be breaking changes): grunt-contrib-connect, grunt-contrib-connect, grunt-contrib-jshint

### 2.2.0 (2013-12-23)

* Turn on 90-character limit per line

### 2.1.4 (2013-12-22)

* Update to my fork of `groc` which prevents it from being broken after `jade` 1.0.0 release

### 2.1.3 (2013-12-21)

* Fix crash if 'bower_components' folder doesn't exist

### 2.1.2 (2013-12-16)

* updating minor version: `grunt-mocha-cli` (now at mocha 1.15, also has my [pull request](https://github.com/Rowno/grunt-mocha-cli/pull/8))
* updating patch version: `grunt-env`, `grunt-mocha`, `time-grunt` (time grunt update actually brings its output back under `grunt` 0.4.2)

### 2.1.1 (2013-12-14)

* adding `async` to `bowerSpecialCases`

### 2.1.0 (2013-12-02)

* new: task 'test-all' for easy code coverage testing

### 2.0.0 (2013-12-02)

* `registerCopy()` now takes options param, not files
* `registerCopyFromDist()` now creates just one target
* new: `registerInstall()` for 'npm/bower install'
* new: 'setup' task for installing dependencies

### 1.4.1 (2013-11-30)

* can use `bowerSpecialCases` to customize the behavior of `registerCopyFromBower()`. two special-cases are included by default: lodash (dist/lodash.compat.js) and requirejs (require.js)

### 1.4.0 (2013-11-29)

* new method: `registerCopyFromBower()` - pulls javascript files installed by bower into your lib/vendor directory
* `registerCopy()` can be called more than once; also called by `registerCopyFromBower()` and `registerCopyFromDist` to ensure `grunt-contrib-copy` task is ready for use
* dependency update: latest versions of lodash, grunt-contrib-jshint, grunt-mocha, time-grunt, and grunt

### 1.3.0 (2013-11-22)

* registerTest: now allows customization of source files to ensure that your 'run-on-change' task behaves properly

### 1.2.3 (2013-11-22)

* Re-ordering parameters in registerStaticAnalysis (now it's files first, then jshintrc path)

### 1.2.2 (2013-11-19)

* Fix to registerOptimize: fix task name collision for multiple libraries based off of the same root javascript file

### 1.2.1 (2013-11-19)

* Fix to registerOptimize: allow multiple libraries based off of the same root javascript file (take name for task from the output file, not the input file)

### 1.2.0 (2013-11-18)

* new method: `registerCopyFromDist()` - pulls files out of `dist/` folders of installed node modules
* `registerCopy()` files parameter now optional

### 1.1.0 (2013-11-17)

* new method: `registerCopy()` - pulls in `grunt-contrib-copy` task, passes `files` parameter to it
* new method: `registerConnect()` - sets up two targets: test (port 3001) and keepalive (port 3000)
* new method: `registerOptimize()` - uses `grunt-requirejs` to optimize and concatenate AMD files, producing unoptimized and, if requested, standalone files based on almond.js
* new method: `registerMocha()` - running phantomjs-based in-browser unit tests. Works well with `registerConnect()`

### 1.0.3 (2013-11-14)

* adding 'dist' target to  `registerClean()`

### 1.0.2 (2013-11-11)

* `registerStaticAnalysis()` uses .jshintrc file inside this project by default, to make it that much easier to set up a new project.

### 1.0.1 (2013-11-11)

* new: `loadLocalNpm()` loads tasks from node modules installed as dependencies of this library, not from the project which is using this library.

### 1.0.0 (2013-11-11)

* Initial release
* time-grunt, env, testing with mocha-cli, jshint, complexity, groc and fix-groc-stylesheet, clean, watch, filter, code coverage support in testing
