# thehelp-project

This project is designed to get a high quality grunt-based project automation setup in place very quickly.

## Features

Grunt task setup:

* time-grunt
* env (using env.json)
* mocha-cli for 'unit', 'integration' and 'interactive' tasks, running everything underneath 'test/<test type>' excluding the 'client' subdirectory
* command-line options supported for tests: 'grep', 'coverage', 'reporter' and 'bail'
* staticanalysis, encompassing two tasks: jshint and complexity
* doc, wrapping two tasks: groc and fix-groc-stylesheet
* watch core setup and subtasks for tests, static analysis and documentation generation
* `modifiedInLast()` method to filter files processed using the grunt 'partial' command-line option
* clean, deleting public/*, tmp/* by default, and extended to include files under doc if you call `registerDoc()`

## Jump in!

### Install

Include the project in your dependencies:

```
"thehelp-project": "git+ssh://git@infra:thehelp-project#v1.0.0"
```

### Usage

To get up and running very quickly with all defaults, just put this in your Gruntfile:

```
var GruntConfig = require('thehelp-project').GruntConfig;
var config = new GruntConfig(grunt);
config.standardSetup();
config.standardDefault();
```

## History

### 2.4.2

* Patch versions: groc (actually a no-op change; fixing tag version to match package.json)
* Minor versions: grunt-contrib-jshint (better error output! woo!), grunt-contrib-watch, grunt-mocha-cli, time-grunt (color!)
* Dev dependencies: chai, grunt

### 2.4.1

* Upgrading to [groc@0.6.4 (from my branch)](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/groc/releases/tag/v0.6.4). Pulls in `jade` 1.x, something that the main `groc` project has resisted doing. But it didn't even change the generated documentation.

### 2.4.0

* `registerOptimize()` now turns on source map generation unless it's been explicitly configured.

### 2.3.0

* Patch updates: grunt-complexity, grunt-groc, grunt-mocha, grunt-requirejs, grunt-shell, time-grunt, grunt
* Minor version updates: chai, sinon
* Minor version below v1 (could be breaking changes): grunt-contrib-connect, grunt-contrib-connect, grunt-contrib-jshint

### 2.2.0

* Turn on 90-character limit per line

### 2.1.4

* Update to my fork of `groc` which prevents it from being broken after `jade` 1.0.0 release

### 2.1.3

* Fix crash if 'bower_components' folder doesn't exist

### 2.1.2

* updating minor version: `grunt-mocha-cli` (now at mocha 1.15, also has my [pull request](https://github.com/Rowno/grunt-mocha-cli/pull/8))
* updating patch version: `grunt-env`, `grunt-mocha`, `time-grunt` (time grunt update actually brings its output back under `grunt` 0.4.2)

### 2.1.1

* adding `async` to `bowerSpecialCases`

### 2.1.0

* new: task 'test-all' for easy code coverage testing

### 2.0.0

* `registerCopy()` now takes options param, not files
* `registerCopyFromDist()` now creates just one target
* new: `registerInstall()` for 'npm/bower install'
* new: 'setup' task for installing dependencies

### 1.4.1

* can use `bowerSpecialCases` to customize the behavior of `registerCopyFromBower()`. two special-cases are included by default: lodash (dist/lodash.compat.js) and requirejs (require.js)

### 1.4.0

* new method: `registerCopyFromBower()` - pulls javascript files installed by bower into your lib/vendor directory
* `registerCopy()` can be called more than once; also called by `registerCopyFromBower()` and `registerCopyFromDist` to ensure `grunt-contrib-copy` task is ready for use
* dependency update: latest versions of lodash, grunt-contrib-jshint, grunt-mocha, time-grunt, and grunt

### 1.3.0

* registerTest: now allows customization of source files to ensure that your 'run-on-change' task behaves properly

### 1.2.3

* Re-ordering parameters in registerStaticAnalysis (now it's files first, then jshintrc path)

### 1.2.2

* Fix to registerOptimize: fix task name collision for multiple libraries based off of the same root javascript file

### 1.2.1

* Fix to registerOptimize: allow multiple libraries based off of the same root javascript file (take name for task from the output file, not the input file)

### 1.2.0

* new method: `registerCopyFromDist()` - pulls files out of `dist/` folders of installed node modules
* `registerCopy()` files parameter now optional

### 1.1.0

* new method: `registerCopy()` - pulls in `grunt-contrib-copy` task, passes `files` parameter to it
* new method: `registerConnect()` - sets up two targets: test (port 3001) and keepalive (port 3000)
* new method: `registerOptimize()` - uses `grunt-requirejs` to optimize and concatenate AMD files, producing unoptimized and, if requested, standalone files based on almond.js
* new method: `registerMocha()` - running phantomjs-based in-browser unit tests. Works well with `registerConnect()`

### 1.0.3

* adding 'dist' target to  `registerClean()`

### 1.0.2

* `registerStaticAnalysis()` uses .jshintrc file inside this project by default, to make it that much easier to set up a new project.

### 1.0.1

* new: `loadLocalNpm()` loads tasks from node modules installed as dependencies of this library, not from the project which is using this library.

### 1.0.0

* Initial release
* time-grunt, env, testing with mocha-cli, jshint, complexity, groc and fix-groc-stylesheet, clean, watch, filter, code coverage support in testing,
